You can import your own components.

<Message>MDX gives you JSX in Markdown!</Message>

## MDX

MDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, perfect for technical blogs. MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). You can learn more about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).

This is a post showing MDX in action. This starter now comes with MDX out-of-the-box!

```js
// you can write JSX in your Markdown!
<button>test</button>
```

<button>test</button>
