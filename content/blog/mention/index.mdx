						content: "Adrien has been a great resource for Mention. He onboarded extremely quickly and efficiently, which has maintained as the theme throughout our work together. Adrien has integrated designs for us with precision in addition to building out the proper back-end integration so non-technical team members can edit the content (Wordpress & HubSpot). He manages his time well, and consistently meets deadlines. Whenever there is an unexpected bug, he makes time to fix the problem, even when not ‘on the clock’. Additionally, he’s time estimations are extremely accurate, which is a highly valued skill. Finding good front-end talent is always tough, so if you have the ability to work with Adrien I highly recommend it.",
