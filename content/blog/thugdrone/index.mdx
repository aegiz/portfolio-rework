description: In 2014 I joined the exciting <a href="http://edouardleurent.com/project/icarus/" target="_blank">Icarus' project</a>.<br><br>As my partners had already made a fully customisable drone, I sugggested to pioneer a new kind of aerial craft that would be able to project paint on unreachable walls<span>:</span> the ThugDrone!
